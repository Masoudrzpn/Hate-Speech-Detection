# Hate-Speech-Detection
A project for performing binary classification tasks on textual data, utilizing HateBERT, a pre-trained language model, along with Transformer-based architectures. This code includes training, evaluation, and testing procedures for hate speech detection.


## General information
This folder contains the code for the [`HateBERT`](https://huggingface.co/GroNLP/hateBERT) model that was used for the project.
All code makes use of Huggingface models and the Transformers package to import these models.

***A [`Requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt) file is provided within the root folder of this project.***
