# Hate-Speech-Detection
A project for performing binary classification tasks on textual data, utilizing HateBERT, a pre-trained language model, along with Transformer-based architectures. This code includes training, evaluation, and testing procedures for hate speech detection.

## General information
This folder contains the code for the [`HateBERT`](https://huggingface.co/GroNLP/hateBERT) model that was used for the project.
All code makes use of Huggingface models and the Transformers package to import these models.

## Requirements
Tested on Python 3.11.3, but anything close to that is likely to work as well.

To run the model, one is required to install a small number of packages which can be found in requirements.txt.
